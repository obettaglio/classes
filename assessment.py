Part 1: Discussion

1. What are the three main design advantages that object orientation
   can provide? Explain each concept.

   Encapsulation: the ability to package information and tasks together for ease of use.
   Abstraction: the ability to trust the package to complete its internal processes without user oversight.
   Polymorphism: the ability to apply one package of class attributes to multiple different objects.

2. What is a class?

    A class is a type of object that collects similar information about all of its instances.
    It has the ability to establish common attributes at each instance's instantiation while still
    providing painless adjustment for individual instances if necessary.

3. What is an instance attribute?

    An instance attribute is a characteristic of the instance that is not necessarily shared by
    other instances of the same class. It is specific to the instance, and will be referred to
    first when checking for any attribute.

4. What is a method?

    A method is a function within a class that can be called by all instances and subclasses.

5. What is an instance in object orientation?

    An instance is an individual object created from a class and inheriting its class attributes
    and methods.

6. How is a class attribute different than an instance attribute?
   Give an example of when you might use each.

   A class attribute is common for all instances created under it. It is an easy way to
   standardize the definition of the class, while leaving room for exceptions.

   An instance attribute is specific to the instance. Since it is viewed first by Python,
   its existence overrides any class attributes above it. This is useful for an object that
   has many shared characteristics with other instances of a class, but behaves differently
   in one or two aspects.
